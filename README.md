# Wholesale-Classification
**1 K-nearest neighbor classification**

1. Implement k-nn and test on the dataset. Calculate the classification error? (by comparing
the class labels obtained with the prediction and the original labels of test data)
2. Vary the value of k
3. Try to normalize the input dataset, is the performance better?
4. Apply PCA and SVD on the dataset, then what is the performance of k-nn on the new projected data?
5. Propose an approach to improve the performance of k-nn with the help of k-cross validation.

**2 Perceptron classifier**

  Plot linear classifiers for dataset (using PCA or SVD to reduce the number of dimensions to 2D)
